# Migrated from AWS to GitHub Pages

So the old www.bentham-white.co.uk site has been running for almost a year now on an AWS EC2 instance (free tier). I've been very impressed with AWS; it was very easy to setup and I've had absolutely zero downtime (much better than the previous hosting partner Rackspace to be honest). But the free 12 months is drawing to a close at the end of this month so I've been exploring other (potentially cheaper) options, this is when I discovered GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages

I've been aware of GitHub for some time (and even used it myself on a few occasions for a couple of development projects such as my Mobile-->Web Server-->USB Relay-->Garage Door Opener which my wife and I now use pretty much on a daily basis). But I've only recently become aware of GitHub Pages and the fact that users (including commercial organisations) can host super-fast static generated websites absolutely free!

I'll be honest, it took some getting used to, and I've probably spent a couple of days reading various GitHub/Jekyll documentation (some official, some just other people sharing their experiences). But I get it now; and the beauty is in its simplicity. Once you've spent a bit of time choosing an appropriate jekyll theme and then tailored it to your liking (header, footer, custom styles etc.) creating the site's content in markdown is just so straight forward. Every time you submit a change to a file on your GitHub repository the site auto generates and within seconds you have a fresh updated static site.
